# Abhisek-Ghosh
I am Abby — a singer-songwriter, music educator, and lifelong student of music. 
I believe music is not merely performed, but breathed and lived.
Abby is a singer-songwriter and music educator whose work lives at the intersection of expression and discipline. Trained in both performance and pedagogy, he moves fluidly between stage and studio, guided by a belief that music is not something we merely perform, but something we breathe and live.
As an artist, Abby searches for honesty—sound that feels human, vulnerable, and awake. As a teacher, he focuses on building strong musical foundations while nurturing curiosity, independence, and joy. His approach is shaped by years of formal training, deep listening, and a commitment to helping each student find their own voice.
Whether performing, teaching, or learning, Abby remains a lifelong student of music—drawn to the quiet details where technique turns into meaning.
